# NixieClock
Arduino Code for my Nixie tube clock


This no longer uses a DS3231 real time clock(it never worked quite right), Arduino Nano, 4 nixie tubes, and K155Id1 nixie tube drivers

PCB gerber zip is now in the repo, it is better labled

the DCDC converter used can be found at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KWGDZP7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

will update as project progresses
